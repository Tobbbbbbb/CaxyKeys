# CaxyKeys

This project is made for my school's student ambassador group, the Caxy Keys. It is designed to help assign prospective students to current students.
It first takes in data from current students via a form which asks them about numerous things including gender, grade, interests, clubs, sports, etc.
There is also a similar form which administrators will fill out for prospective students.
Lastly, administrators can download student data from veracross which will load students' schedule.
The program then orders current students relative to prospective students based on factors like interests, clubs, sports, gender, day vs boarding, etc.
The program finishes by returning the top 5 current students for the selected prospective student and the reasons they were chosen.
I'm currently working on creating a GUI to go with the program.
